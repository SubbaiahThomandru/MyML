# My Machine learning Models
Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.

This repo contains types of machine learning techniques and examples in python.

Types of learning algorithms :

1	Supervised and semi-supervised learning

  Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest       Regression
  
  Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification
  
  Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat

2	Unsupervised learning
  
  Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering

3	Reinforcement learning
  
  Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling
