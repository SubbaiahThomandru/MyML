 Bayes’ Theorem

Naive” because it makes an assumption that is virtually impossible to see in real-life data: 

 L1 and L2 regularization.


 Type I and Type II error(Type I error is a false positive, while Type II error is a false negative. )
A clever way to think about this is to think of Type I error as telling a man he is pregnant, while Type II error means you tell a pregnant woman she isn’t carrying a baby.
